# Geological Image Similarity

#### BACKGROUND
A geology research company wants to create a tool for identifying interesting patterns in their imagery data. This tool
will possess a search capability whereby an analyst provides an image of interest and is presented with other images
which are similar to it.

#### GOAL
Our task is to create the machine learning component for this image similarity application. The machine learning
model should return the top K images that are most similar to this image based on a single image input.
